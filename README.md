Hi, I'm C7YPY0N1C 👋

I occasionally dabble in code. Anything I find worth sharing will be pushed to GitHub 😁

Might host my own git-type service cuz why not 🤷🏿‍♂️

I work with a few operating systems, but I ain't a pro just yet:
Windows: 10
Linux: Ubuntu, Kali, Debian, Fedora, Arch (?)

Anyways, yeah hi lmao
